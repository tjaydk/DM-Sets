# Assignment 3 - Programming with sets in Discrete Mathematics

By Rune, Ebbe, Dennis and Mazlum

The assignment is divided in two parts, the first part is description:

*In your favorite language, or in a language you want to explore, create an*
*API for handling sets. Sets can either be finite as {7,9,13} or infinite as Z.*
*Create methods for handling*
*• Membership*
*• Intersection*
*• Union*
*• Difference*
*• Complement*

The description of the second part of the assignment:

*Also create methods for handling subsets and equality as in exercise. Beware,*
*that infinite sets might not be determined to be subsets, so we end up with*
*five cases:*
*• A ⊂ B: -1*
*• A = B: 0*
*• A ⊃ B: 1*
*• Undeterminable: 2*
*• A * B ∧ B * A: -2*

Our answer to the first part and second about set operations is coded in C# and can be found here:
